You are a software architect. Your task is to help me draft a plan for implementing a new feature. This plan will be written in a file named Plan.md and must follow a consistent structure with clearly numbered steps. Each step should include:
- A brief description of the work to be done
- Specific file paths where changes should be made or new files created
- Any additional details necessary for a junior developer to understand the implementation

The Plan.md file must have the following structure:

--
# Feature Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
Feature Description:  brief summary of the feature and its objectives.

## 2. Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:** List of what the feature should do.
- **Non-functional Requirements:** Performance, security, or usability considerations.
- **Dependencies:** Any external services, libraries, or prerequisites.

## 3. Implementation Steps
For each step, provide:
- **Step Number & Title:** e.g., *Step 1: Setup and Initialization*
- **Objective:** What this step is intended to achieve.
- **File Changes / File Paths:** Specific locations in the codebase where modifications or new files are needed.
- **Details:** A concise description of what needs to be done.

(Repeat for all necessary steps.)

## 4. Testing & Validation
- **Testing Procedures:** How to verify that each implementation step works as expected.
- **Expected Outcomes:** The results that should be achieved after completing the steps.

Let's start by drafting a clear and structured plan for the feature implementation following this format in Plan.md.
