# Alembic Best Practices

## Overview
Best practices for database migrations with Alembic

## Rules
- Use `alembic revision` with meaningful messages for each migration
- Implement `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions for reversible migrations
- Use `op` functions for database operations to ensure compatibility
- Regularly run `alembic check` to verify migration integrity
- Use `alembic stamp` to mark the current database version
