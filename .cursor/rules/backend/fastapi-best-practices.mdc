# FastAPI Best Practices

## Overview
Best practices for building FastAPI applications

## Rules
- Use `Depends` for dependency injection to manage resources and authentication
- Implement proper error handling with custom exception handlers
- Use `pydantic` models for request/response validation and serialization
- Leverage async/await for better performance in I/O-bound operations
- Use `BackgroundTasks` for long-running operations to keep the API responsive
