# HTTPX Best Practices

## Overview
Best practices for making HTTP requests with HTTPX

## Rules
- Use async client for better performance in concurrent requests
- Implement proper timeout settings to prevent hanging requests
- Use `raise_for_status()` to handle HTTP errors gracefully
- Leverage streaming for large payloads to reduce memory usage
- Use `HTTPX` with `Depends` in FastAPI for consistent request handling
